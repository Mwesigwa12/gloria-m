        <h4>A BRIEF HISTORY ABOUT BUGEMA UNIVERSITY</h4>
        <p>Bugema university was started in 1948 as a training school for teachers and pastors for the seventh day adventist church in east africa. By that time it was called bugema missionary training school. Later the name changed to bugema missinary college and then to bugema adventist college</p>
        <p>When president id amin banned the seventh day adventist church in 1977, the porogram was temporarily moved to nairobi where the fast degree students graduated with a bachelor in theolgy in 1978. the campus was then relocated to the church youthful camp (at watamamu north of mombasa) until idi amin fled uganda. the college was then moved back to bugema campus</p>
        <p>The college expanded, by the late 1980's curricula for business and education were added. In 1994 bugema adventist college changed it's status from college to university. In 1997, bugema was granted a tertiary instituion lisence from the ministry of education and sports.</p>
